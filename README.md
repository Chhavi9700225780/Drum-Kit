## 🌟 How You Can Enhance this Project as a Beginner
 **If you're looking to contribute or experiment with this project, here are some beginner-friendly suggestions:**

1. **Add More Sound Effects**: Extend the range of sounds by adding more ``.wav`` or ```.mp3``` files in the ```sounds/``` directory and updating the JavaScript logic.

2. **Visual Feedback on Key Press**: Add animations or color changes to drum pads when they are clicked or activated by keyboard keys. This can be achieved with CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling.

3. **Volume Control**: Add a volume slider to control the sound output level, giving users more flexibility.

4. **Record and Playback Feature**: Introduce a feature to record sequences of drum beats and play them back.

5. **Theme Customization**: Allow users to switch between dark and light themes for a personalized experience.
